            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>Our mission is to raise awareness and provide valuable insights into waste management issues. We aim to drive change and promote sustainable solid waste management practices through research, education, and advocacy.<br>
                
<br>Controlling solid waste is crucial for environmental sustainability and public health. Effective solid waste management involves minimizing waste generation, promoting recycling and reuse, and safely disposing of waste that cannot be recycled. Here are several ways to control solid waste:<br>

<br><b>Source Reduction:</b><br>

Encourage the use of products with minimal packaging.
Promote the concept of "reduce, reuse, and recycle" to minimize overall waste generation.
Implement policies to discourage single-use items.<br>
<br><b>Recycling Programs:</b><br>

Establish and promote recycling programs for materials like paper, plastic, glass, and metal.
Provide convenient recycling bins in public spaces, offices, and residential areas.
Educate the community about the importance of recycling and how to do it properly.<br>
<br><b>Composting:</b><br>

Encourage composting of organic waste, such as food scraps and yard waste.
Provide composting bins or facilities for households and businesses.

Make it easy for residents and businesses to separate recyclables, compostables, and non-recyclables.<br>
<br><b>Waste-to-Energy Programs:</b><br>

Explore and invest in waste-to-energy technologies that convert waste into energy.
Implement programs that harness energy from landfill gas or incineration processes.<br>
<br><b>Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR):</b><br>

Enforce EPR policies that hold manufacturers responsible for the entire lifecycle of their products, including proper disposal.
Encourage producers to design products that are easily recyclable.<br>
